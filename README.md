# CodeTogether | Hackaton Submission

Built for the [Web Dev Cody Hackaton](https://hackathon.webdevcody.com), CodeTogether is a fully featured, cross browser, totally not buggy ðŸ˜…, collaborative coding platform (or app?) that can be used to easily share your project when you need help with something or if you brave enough, use it when you want to collaborate with other developers on an entire project.

## Features
- [x] Create Project Linked to Github Repo
- [x] Invite Members
- [x] Drag and Drop files into Workspace
- [x] Code Editor with Multi language support
- [x] Realtime Code editing

## So, How do i run it?
Its easy, just:
- Yoink the repo ðŸ˜…
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Run `npx convex dev` to setup your convex project and sync your schema and functions
- Create a clerk project and setup a Convex JWT template named "convex" because we need it for auth (check auth.config.js)
- Go to convex dashboard and setup your CLERK_CONVEX_ISSUER_URL copied from the JWT template
- Edit `/src/pages/Root.tsx` to use your clerk publishable key on the ClerkProvider (using .env.local for this wasn't possible because it kept being replaced by convex dev or so i think)
- Create a `.env.local` with CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT and VITE_CONVEX_URL variables (npx convex dev should have created this for you)
- `npm run dev`
#### TODO (Soon)
- [ ] Delete Members
- [ ] Leave Project
- [ ] Presense (See who's online)
- [ ] Code Presense (See who's editing what)
- [ ] Better Authorization (Only Project owner should be able to invite or remove members)

#### TODO (Dauting)
- [ ] Branches, Commits And PR Support
- [ ] VS Code Extension for better code presense
- [ ] Lines, Shapes, and Text drawing capabilities
- [ ] Codesandbox esque web environment (HELP!)

### Known Issues
- File selector freezes on large repos
- Editor position synching not the best
- Many more waiting to be discovered...
